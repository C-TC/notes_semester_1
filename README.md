# notes_semester_1

This repository is to document the course material of my first semester in ETHz.

First plan is to finish the lecture notes with latex format equations. 

If I have spare time, I will add some related materials, but this is not guaranteed.

Course List:
* Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence
* Image Analysis and Computer Vision
* Mathematical Optimization
* Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control

*all image files are added into gitignore to keep this repository clean.*
